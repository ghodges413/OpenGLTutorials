# Megatextured Terrain
![Terrain Sample Screenshot](screenshot.jpg)

This is a 10km x 10km terrain that is properly textured using virtual texturing.

The virtual texture is generated on demand using tile textures.

The texture tiles are creative commons and can be found by their creator here: https://3dtextures.me/

The height map is generated using Fractal Brownian Motion.
