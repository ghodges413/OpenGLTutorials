# Behavior Trees
![BehaviorTree](screenshot.jpg)

This sample uses a behavior tree to control the decision making for an NPC that runs around the map.

A lot of behavior trees are visually scripted.  However, creating a visual scripting language is beyond the scope of this sample.  So the entire tree is implemented in code only.

Here are some resources to help explain behavior trees:
